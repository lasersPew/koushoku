          This website will never show you ads under any circumstances. This website is a "hobby" project, and is
          sustained by my own pocket money a.k.a "doing it for free" a.k.a $0/h. The longevity of this website depends
          on whether or not I, the VPS provider or the domain registrar could avoid legal troubles (e.g., subpoena).
          This website is using Google Analytics to collect page views, but you can use uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger
          to block it.

          The source code of this website is available on GitHub under the GPLv3 license, so if this website is taken
          down, hopefully some kind anon out there will take the torch. This website is also available on Tachiyomi, but
          navigating and searching might be sucks because I couldn't care less about it.
